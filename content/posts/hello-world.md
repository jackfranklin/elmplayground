After a few years of writing about JavaScript on the [JavaScript Playground](http://wwww.javascriptplayground.com) and wanting to write about Elm, I've decided to start this blog to provide a home for any Elm related content. The JavaScript Playground will still be active, but you can expect a semi regular stream of Elm posts too.

Over the last 10 months or so since getting to know Elm I've been blown away with how much I enjoy working in it. I am a huge fan of JavaScript (which is good, as it still pays the bills!) but no other language comes close to Elm in terms of enjoyment and productivity. The language strikes a great balance of being a strongly typed, functional, compiled language, all things not associated with JavaScript, yet continues to be learned by more and more JavaScript developers wanting a bit more from the language.

I hope as I write on this blog I can get across the reasons why I'm such a huge fan of this library and get others started with Elm through tutorials and articles. If you have any comments or questions, the best thing to do is [find me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin).
