In this first video of a series in which I'll build a shopping list application in Elm, I show you the designs for the site and cover how to start an Elm application. We then build some tabs for our content and explore using create-elm-app to build our applications.

### Next time

Next time we'll use [elm-lang/navigation](https://github.com/elm-lang/navigation) to update our app so the tabs are kept in sync with the URLs. We'll remodel our data structure to make this easy, and see how we can make it so when a user clicks a tab the URL is updated along with the content.
